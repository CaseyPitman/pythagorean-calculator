JavaScript & jQuery

I had a lot of fun with this one. As soon as I started learning about programming I knew I would eventually build this app. I've always been fascinated by the Pythagorean Theorem and its applications beyond the simple right triangle. The logic on this one was straightforward. It was also my first use of jQuery to manipulate the DOM.
